# Les Jardins  
Les Jardins de Valentin is a fictitious e-commerce site. It's an educational project for Code Institute's Full Stack Developer specialization E-Commerce diploma.  

## First Approach  
### The project in a few words  
Les Jardins is an e-commerce website where Internet users can buy products online, direct from the grower. Whether vegetables, fruit, herbs, seedlings or processed products. Customers can buy on the website as they would at the market.  

### User Experience Design  
The user experience has to be as simple as possible, so that Internet users will want to buy products. Payment must be simple but secure, and the website must present the products for sale simply, but with an appropriate description and a transparent price so that the purchasing experience is as transparent and simple as possible. The user must feel safe on this website, must feel confident, know who they're dealing with and want to make a purchase.  
The site is, of course, responsive, so that it displays and functions correctly on cell phones and tablets. Internet users can make their purchases and subscriptions directly from their mobiles, just like any other e-commerce site.  

### Tree Structure  
The site is simple to use, with no frills. The home page presents the activity of the producers, while another page presents all the products.  
Each product is presented on a single page with its photo, price, title, weight per kilo and selling price (sometimes 200gr for certain products like herbs).

## Agile  
I used the Agile methodology to organize my work. I created Epic stories that contain the most important tasks, which are also the biggest in terms of work to be done. Then I split these Epic stories into User stories that detail the different tasks to be done. Some User stories are labeled "MustHave", it's something that is very important and must be present in the final project. Others are labeled "ShouldHave", they are less important, but still interesting to implement. They may not be present in the final project. They will nevertheless be included in the project that will actually be put online for the game organizers.  

### User Stories  
The two users of this site are:  
- Customers  
Customers can be individuals or catering professionals. They can buy fruit and vegetables or other products available in the catalog by weight. Customers want a simple shopping experience, easy payment and the assurance of delivery to their home address. The creation of their personal account should be hassle-free, simple, fun and secure.  
- Admin  
Website administrators can use their dedicated, secure area to put new products on line, take them off sale or modify their price, description or photo. Admins can also consult the various orders, dates, times, amounts and personal information of users, again via the admin panel.  

User Stories represent the various steps and tasks to be carried out to ensure that the experiences of customers and admins are consistent with their usage.
