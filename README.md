## First Approach  
### The project in a few words  
Les Jardins is an e-commerce website where Internet users can buy products online, direct from the grower. Whether vegetables, fruit, herbs, seedlings or processed products. Customers can buy on the website as they would at the market.  

### User Experience Design  
The user experience has to be as simple as possible, so that Internet users will want to buy products. Payment must be simple but secure, and the website must present the products for sale simply, but with an appropriate description and a transparent price so that the purchasing experience is as transparent and simple as possible. The user must feel safe on this website, must feel confident, know who they're dealing with and want to make a purchase.  
The site is, of course, responsive, so that it displays and functions correctly on cell phones and tablets. Internet users can make their purchases and subscriptions directly from their mobiles, just like any other e-commerce site.  

### Tree Structure  
The site is simple to use, with no frills. The home page presents the activity of the producers, while another page presents all the products.  
Each product is presented on a single page with its photo, price, title, weight per kilo and selling price (sometimes 200gr for certain products like herbs).

## Agile  
I used the Agile methodology to organize my work. I created Epic stories that contain the most important tasks, which are also the biggest in terms of work to be done. Then I split these Epic stories into User stories that detail the different tasks to be done. Some User stories are labeled "MustHave", it's something that is very important and must be present in the final project. Others are labeled "ShouldHave", they are less important, but still interesting to implement. They may not be present in the final project. They will nevertheless be included in the project that will actually be put online for the game organizers.  

### User Stories  
The two users of this site are:  
- Customers  
Customers can be individuals or catering professionals. They can buy fruit and vegetables or other products available in the catalog by weight. Customers want a simple shopping experience, easy payment and the assurance of delivery to their home address. The creation of their personal account should be hassle-free, simple, fun and secure.  
- Admin  
Website administrators can use their dedicated, secure area to put new products on line, take them off sale or modify their price, description or photo. Admins can also consult the various orders, dates, times, amounts and personal information of users, again via the admin panel.  

User Stories represent the various steps and tasks to be carried out to ensure that the experiences of customers and admins are consistent with their usage.

## Visual Design  
### Wireframes  
Models are available on this website. They are uncluttered, UX design oriented, in order to offer the user the simplest possible shopping experience. I don't want to add superfluous design or images that don't make sense with the products sold. The site must remain as sober and simple as possible.

### Logo  
The logo is created by myself. It represents the activity of the producers, their link with agriculture. The green color is a reminder of nature and the products of the earth.  
There is no graphic charter for this project, the main colors being green, white for the page background and black for the content text. I want to present a sober, unadorned website, while remaining professional.

I used a color wheel to choose a color to go with the green. Purple completes the color palette of the logo and website.

### Visual Elements  
Font Awesome's icons make it quick and easy to identify the shopping cart and customer area. They also represent the main product categories, as well as illustrating the different product categories.

They have been cropped and optimized for the web by [Bulk Resize Photos](https://bulkresizephotos.com). I have chosen to present the images with a predefined size, always the same, in order to facilitate their processing and display on the website. 
Other photos illustrate the website, on the home page, to add a little content. The pictures are hosted on Cloudinary.

## Marketing  
-__Target customers__  
The site's target customers are people living close to the farm, such as private individuals, catering professionals or catering services in day-care centers, retirement homes, clinics or small businesses. All these target customers are people who want to buy fresh fruit and vegetables, grown in an environmentally-friendly and healthy way.  

-__Presence on platforms__  
Les Jardins will be present on local entrepreneurial platforms, the tourist office, as well as platforms offering workshops such as [Wecandoo](https://wecandoo.fr/) (weekend at the farm, workshops to learn how to look after your vegetable garden).  
You can also sign up for the newsletter. This presents new products, offers discounts from time to time, and encourages recipients to follow Les Jardins on social networks.  
Les Jardins will also be present on social networks such as Facebook and Instagram. It's highly likely that audiences and new customers will arrive on the site via social networks with shares from web users.   

-__Type of content__  
It is possible to create a blog with recipes using the vegetables and fruit currently sold on the website. Make human content by presenting the people who work under the name of Les Jardins. Present their backgrounds, their difficulties, their exploits, to create a link with web users, so that they feel they know the people on the farm without having met them.
There could also be slightly more technical content, which would be in the minority, explaining environmental standards and the legal status of the farm.  
Finally, more practical content about the farm could be shared, such as the food used to feed the hens, introducing where the hens sleep, how to use less water in the garden, what's the right time to plant tomato seedlings in the ground, or how to keep slugs away from salads.  

-__How it works__  
The aim is to make a decent living from selling the farm's produce, attracting new customers and, above all, building customer loyalty. To be able to have a routine with a certain number of fixed customers to be delivered each week.  
We could run promotional campaigns at certain times of the year to attract new customers. Set up a sponsorship system, rewarding the sponsor and the sponsored child with a discount. This action would be broadcast via social networks and why not by email via the newsletter.
Unfortunately, there's no marketing budget at the moment. The best thing to do would be to turn to free solutions and occasionally buy targeted advertising on social networks.  

### Facebook  
Facebook would serve both as a business card that users can share with friends, a means of informing about new products on sale or events organized at the farm. Customers can also leave reviews to judge their shopping experience.
