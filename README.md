## First Approach  
### The project in a few words  
Les Jardins is an e-commerce website where Internet users can buy products online, direct from the grower. Whether vegetables, fruit, herbs, seedlings or processed products. Customers can buy on the website as they would at the market.  

### User Experience Design  
The user experience has to be as simple as possible, so that Internet users will want to buy products. Payment must be simple but secure, and the website must present the products for sale simply, but with an appropriate description and a transparent price so that the purchasing experience is as transparent and simple as possible. The user must feel safe on this website, must feel confident, know who they're dealing with and want to make a purchase.  
The site is, of course, responsive, so that it displays and functions correctly on cell phones and tablets. Internet users can make their purchases and subscriptions directly from their mobiles, just like any other e-commerce site.  

### Tree Structure  
The site is simple to use, with no frills. The home page presents the activity of the producers, while another page presents all the products.  
Each product is presented on a single page with its photo, price, title, weight per kilo and selling price (sometimes 200gr for certain products like herbs).

## Agile  
I used the Agile methodology to organize my work. I created Epic stories that contain the most important tasks, which are also the biggest in terms of work to be done. Then I split these Epic stories into User stories that detail the different tasks to be done. Some User stories are labeled "MustHave", it's something that is very important and must be present in the final project. Others are labeled "ShouldHave", they are less important, but still interesting to implement. They may not be present in the final project. They will nevertheless be included in the project that will actually be put online for the game organizers.  

### User Stories  
The two users of this site are:  
- Customers  
Customers can be individuals or catering professionals. They can buy fruit and vegetables or other products available in the catalog by weight. Customers want a simple shopping experience, easy payment and the assurance of delivery to their home address. The creation of their personal account should be hassle-free, simple, fun and secure.  
- Admin  
Website administrators can use their dedicated, secure area to put new products on line, take them off sale or modify their price, description or photo. Admins can also consult the various orders, dates, times, amounts and personal information of users, again via the admin panel.  

User Stories represent the various steps and tasks to be carried out to ensure that the experiences of customers and admins are consistent with their usage.

## Visual Design  
### Wireframes  
Models are available on this website. They are uncluttered, UX design oriented, in order to offer the user the simplest possible shopping experience. I don't want to add superfluous design or images that don't make sense with the products sold. The site must remain as sober and simple as possible.

### Logo  
The logo is created by myself. It represents the activity of the producers, their link with agriculture. The green color is a reminder of nature and the products of the earth.  
There is no graphic charter for this project, the main colors being green, white for the page background and black for the content text. I want to present a sober, unadorned website, while remaining professional.  

![LOGO](/media/screenshots/logo.png)

I used a color wheel to choose a color to go with the green. Purple completes the color palette of the logo and website.

### Visual Elements  
Font Awesome's icons make it quick and easy to identify the shopping cart and customer area. They also represent the main product categories, as well as illustrating the different product categories.  
Images courtesy of [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com). They are credited at the end of this document in the [Credits photos section](#photos).
They have been cropped and optimized for the web by [Bulk Resize Photos](https://bulkresizephotos.com). I have chosen to present the images with a predefined size, always the same, in order to facilitate their processing and display on the website. 
Other photos illustrate the website, on the home page, to add a little content. The pictures are hosted on Cloudinary.

## Marketing  
-__Target customers__  
The site's target customers are people living close to the farm, such as private individuals, catering professionals or catering services in day-care centers, retirement homes, clinics or small businesses. All these target customers are people who want to buy fresh fruit and vegetables, grown in an environmentally-friendly and healthy way.  

-__Presence on platforms__  
Les Jardins will be present on local entrepreneurial platforms, the tourist office, as well as platforms offering workshops such as [Wecandoo](https://wecandoo.fr/) (weekend at the farm, workshops to learn how to look after your vegetable garden).  
You can also sign up for the newsletter. This presents new products, offers discounts from time to time, and encourages recipients to follow Les Jardins on social networks.  
Les Jardins will also be present on social networks such as Facebook and Instagram. It's highly likely that audiences and new customers will arrive on the site via social networks with shares from web users.   

-__Type of content__  
It is possible to create a blog with recipes using the vegetables and fruit currently sold on the website. Make human content by presenting the people who work under the name of Les Jardins. Present their backgrounds, their difficulties, their exploits, to create a link with web users, so that they feel they know the people on the farm without having met them.
There could also be slightly more technical content, which would be in the minority, explaining environmental standards and the legal status of the farm.  
Finally, more practical content about the farm could be shared, such as the food used to feed the hens, introducing where the hens sleep, how to use less water in the garden, what's the right time to plant tomato seedlings in the ground, or how to keep slugs away from salads.  

-__How it works__  
The aim is to make a decent living from selling the farm's produce, attracting new customers and, above all, building customer loyalty. To be able to have a routine with a certain number of fixed customers to be delivered each week.  
We could run promotional campaigns at certain times of the year to attract new customers. Set up a sponsorship system, rewarding the sponsor and the sponsored child with a discount. This action would be broadcast via social networks and why not by email via the newsletter.
Unfortunately, there's no marketing budget at the moment. The best thing to do would be to turn to free solutions and occasionally buy targeted advertising on social networks.  

### SEO  
Here are the keywords and phrases that relate to the site's activity as well as what users may search for on Google to come across the Les Jardins e-commerce site.  

-__Short keywords__  
| Targets | Products | Other |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| Individuals | Vegetables |  Local |
| Restaurants | Fruits |  Environment |
| Firms | Transform products |  Healthy |
| Families | Transform products |  Farm |
| Un Endroit |  |  Ecology |

-__Long-tail keywords__  
- How to shop locally
- How to buy local fruits and vegetables
- How to take control of your health
- How to subscribe to vegetable baskets near me
- Finance a local producer
- Know what you're eating

### Facebook  
Facebook would serve both as a business card that users can share with friends, a means of informing about new products on sale or events organized at the farm. Customers can also leave reviews to judge their shopping experience.

### GDR  
Concerning the General Data Protection Regulation, I have generated the privacy policy with this [Privacy Policy Generator](https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info).  
The [link](https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/live.php?token=5wXhzvlMcnTpFj7LohuincImAdadxGA3) is visible in the footer of the website.  

[Go back to the Table of content](#table-of-content)  

## Development  
The organization of the website is very simple. It is composed of several content pages, accessible to all:  
- Home page  
- Products  
- Contact  
- Shopping Bag  
- Checkout  

Login pages for: 
- register  
- log in  
- log out  
- edit the profile  

Admins have access to a dedicated area where they can consult lists of users and orders, as well as lists of products and their categories. Like users, they can also manage the catalog by logging on to the website. They can add, edit or delete products.   
 
Pages 404 and 500 are also available. 

### Database  
-__Json Files__  
I decide to create json files for adding my categories and products to the database. This allows me to keep a backup of the database in case I need to reinitialize it. If I upload products and categories directly via the admin panel, I could lose everything. So I prefer to use json files.  
I then copied the "categories" file from the boutique Ado project. And replace the categories with my own. I then uploaded the categories.json file to the IDE with the **python3 manage.py loaddata categories** command, which retrieves the data stored in this file.  
To create the JSON file for my products, I first gathered all my information (name, price, image name, image url, category, sku, descriptions, etc.) in an excel document.  

![EXCEL DOCUMENT WITH PRODUCTS](/media/screenshots/excel-file-products.png)  

Then, I converted this excel document into JSON format with [this convertor](https://codebeautify.org/excel-to-json).  
I then formatted this file with (Json Formatter)[https://jsonformatter.org] to make it more compact. I then pasted the data into a "products.json" document and typed the **python3 manage.py loaddata products** command to retrieve the data stored in this file.

### Page Construction  
I used **Django templates** to build my pages.  
The source file for html pages is **base.html**. The different content pages use this document to load common elements such as the footer or the navigation, among others. The content pages only contain their own content. The latter calls the header and footer, which are two different files stored in the **"includes" folder**. I made this choice because I want my base.html file to be as clear as possible. There's a lot of information in the footer and header, plus two menus, one for large screens and the collapse menu.  
The stylesheet is called by the link **{% static 'css/style.css' %}** so that all pages regardless of their location.  

### Menu
The menu presents the different product categories (vegetables, fruit, other products), as well as access to registration and login to the customer account. There is also access to the profile if the user is logged in. The user also has access to the shopping bag.  
The menu is condensed when the site is used on a small screen. Products, login information and the shopping bag are then accessed via the hamburger icon. I didn't want to have a dropdown menu to facilitate user experience and reading. I therefore decided to group certain categories under the "other products" link. "Other products" includes dry vegetabes, groceries, plants and seeds.  

### Online Paiement  
Online payment is handled by the **Stripe service**. There are a number of steps involved in getting the service up and running. You can help yourself with the Stripe documentation for installation.  

To use Stripe's services, you need to set up an account and confirm your e-mail address. The latter gives access to the developer mode, which enables you to test whether online payment works correctly on your site. All you need to do is enter a fictitious card (made up of a series of numbers 42) to run the tests.  

![STRIPE DEVELOPER VIEW](/media/screenshots/stripe-developers-view.png) 

In addition to the various information to be included in the settings.py document, the public and secret keys to be entered in the env.py document (so that they remain hidden when the site goes online) and in the Config Vars in the Heroku settings, you need to add the Javascript line **<script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>** in the **{% corejs %}** block of the base.html page. Stripe recommends adding this line in this document so that the service is accessible on all pages of the site, which allows some of their more advanced fraud detection features to work.  

### Features  
-__Home Page__  
The Home Page welcomes the user with a photo of vegetables, so that at a glance the user has an idea of the products sold on the site. A button gives access to all the products. Text informs the user of the company's activities and values, and provides SEO information. Important words are then placed either in headlines or in bold.  

-__Products__  
The page presents all the products on sale on the website. Items are presented with product name, photo, selling price, selling weight and weight per kilo.  

-__Product Details__  
Each product has its own dedicated page. On it, the user can find the product image, the artist's name, the weight per kilo, the sales weight (i.e. how much is sold for one unit of the product) and the sales price.
A brief description presents the product, with cooking instructions or tasting suggestions. It is possible to choose a quantity and add this selection to the basket.  

-__Shopping Bag__  
The shopping basket enables users to identify at a glance the items they have selected and wish to purchase. The photo and name of the product are of course shown, along with the weight, quantity and selling price. The latter is multiplied by the quantity if several units have been selected.  

The user can view the amount of the products, the shipping costs and the total amount to be paid. Shipping costs are 10% of the total amount. The user can decide to modify products, add or subtract quantities, or remove the product from the basket. The amounts to be paid and shipping costs are then automatically updated. Finally, the user can decide whether to continue shopping or proceed to payment by clicking on "Secure checkout".  

![SHOPPING BAG](/media/screenshots/shopping-bag.png)  

-__Checkout__  
This page allows the user to enter personal information. These are automatically filled in if the user has a customer account. 
Bank details are entered here. Online payment is handled by Stripe. An email is sent to the user to confirm the order.
