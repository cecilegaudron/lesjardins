# Les Jardins  
Les Jardins de Valentin is a fictitious e-commerce site. It's an educational project for Code Institute's Full Stack Developer specialization E-Commerce diploma.  

Unfortunately, I've been caught in time that I haven't been successfull to correct some things that aren't working properly, or to fine-tune others. I'm not proud of my work. I am so sorry about that.  I hope to do better in the resubmission.

## First Approach  
### The project in a few words  
Les Jardins is an e-commerce website where Internet users can buy products online, direct from the grower. Whether vegetables, fruit, herbs, seedlings or processed products. Customers can buy on the website as they would at the market.  

### User Experience Design  
The user experience has to be as simple as possible, so that Internet users will want to buy products. Payment must be simple but secure, and the website must present the products for sale simply, but with an appropriate description and a transparent price so that the purchasing experience is as transparent and simple as possible. The user must feel safe on this website, must feel confident, know who they're dealing with and want to make a purchase.  
The site is, of course, responsive, so that it displays and functions correctly on cell phones and tablets. Internet users can make their purchases and subscriptions directly from their mobiles, just like any other e-commerce site.  

### Tree Structure  
The site is simple to use, with no frills. The home page presents the activity of the producers, while another page presents all the products.  
Each product is presented on a single page with its photo, price, title, weight per kilo and selling price (sometimes 200gr for certain products like herbs).

## Agile  
I used the Agile methodology to organize my work. I created Epic stories that contain the most important tasks, which are also the biggest in terms of work to be done. Then I split these Epic stories into User stories that detail the different tasks to be done. Some User stories are labeled "MustHave", it's something that is very important and must be present in the final project. Others are labeled "ShouldHave", they are less important, but still interesting to implement. They may not be present in the final project. They will nevertheless be included in the project that will actually be put online for the game organizers.  

### User Stories  
The two users of this site are:  
- Customers  
Customers can be individuals or catering professionals. They can buy fruit and vegetables or other products available in the catalog by weight. Customers want a simple shopping experience, easy payment and the assurance of delivery to their home address. The creation of their personal account should be hassle-free, simple, fun and secure.  
- Admin  
Website administrators can use their dedicated, secure area to put new products on line, take them off sale or modify their price, description or photo. Admins can also consult the various orders, dates, times, amounts and personal information of users, again via the admin panel.  

User Stories represent the various steps and tasks to be carried out to ensure that the experiences of customers and admins are consistent with their usage.

## Visual Design  
### Wireframes  
Models are available on this website. They are uncluttered, UX design oriented, in order to offer the user the simplest possible shopping experience. I don't want to add superfluous design or images that don't make sense with the products sold. The site must remain as sober and simple as possible.

### Logo  
The logo is created by myself. It represents the activity of the producers, their link with agriculture. The green color is a reminder of nature and the products of the earth.  
There is no graphic charter for this project, the main colors being green, white for the page background and black for the content text. I want to present a sober, unadorned website, while remaining professional.  

![LOGO](/media/screenshots/logo.png)

I used a color wheel to choose a color to go with the green. Purple completes the color palette of the logo and website.  

![COLORS](/media/screenshots/colors.png)

### Visual Elements  
Font Awesome's icons make it quick and easy to identify the shopping cart and customer area. They also represent the main product categories, as well as illustrating the different product categories.  
Images courtesy of [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com). They are credited at the end of this document in the [Credits photos section](#photos).
They have been cropped and optimized for the web by [Bulk Resize Photos](https://bulkresizephotos.com). I have chosen to present the images with a predefined size, always the same, in order to facilitate their processing and display on the website. 
Other photos illustrate the website, on the home page, to add a little content. The pictures are hosted on Cloudinary.

## Marketing  
-__Target customers__  
The site's target customers are people living close to the farm, such as private individuals, catering professionals or catering services in day-care centers, retirement homes, clinics or small businesses. All these target customers are people who want to buy fresh fruit and vegetables, grown in an environmentally-friendly and healthy way.  

-__Presence on platforms__  
Les Jardins will be present on local entrepreneurial platforms, the tourist office, as well as platforms offering workshops such as [Wecandoo](https://wecandoo.fr/) (weekend at the farm, workshops to learn how to look after your vegetable garden).  
You can also sign up for the newsletter. This presents new products, offers discounts from time to time, and encourages recipients to follow Les Jardins on social networks.  
Les Jardins will also be present on social networks such as Facebook and Instagram. It's highly likely that audiences and new customers will arrive on the site via social networks with shares from web users.   

-__Type of content__  
It is possible to create a blog with recipes using the vegetables and fruit currently sold on the website. Make human content by presenting the people who work under the name of Les Jardins. Present their backgrounds, their difficulties, their exploits, to create a link with web users, so that they feel they know the people on the farm without having met them.
There could also be slightly more technical content, which would be in the minority, explaining environmental standards and the legal status of the farm.  
Finally, more practical content about the farm could be shared, such as the food used to feed the hens, introducing where the hens sleep, how to use less water in the garden, what's the right time to plant tomato seedlings in the ground, or how to keep slugs away from salads.  

-__How it works__  
The aim is to make a decent living from selling the farm's produce, attracting new customers and, above all, building customer loyalty. To be able to have a routine with a certain number of fixed customers to be delivered each week.  
We could run promotional campaigns at certain times of the year to attract new customers. Set up a sponsorship system, rewarding the sponsor and the sponsored child with a discount. This action would be broadcast via social networks and why not by email via the newsletter.
Unfortunately, there's no marketing budget at the moment. The best thing to do would be to turn to free solutions and occasionally buy targeted advertising on social networks.  

### SEO  
Here are the keywords and phrases that relate to the site's activity as well as what users may search for on Google to come across the Les Jardins e-commerce site.  

-__Short keywords__  
| Targets | Products | Other |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| Individuals | Vegetables |  Local |
| Restaurants | Fruits |  Environment |
| Firms | Transform products |  Healthy |
| Families | Transform products |  Farm |
| Un Endroit |  |  Ecology |

-__Long-tail keywords__  
- How to shop locally
- How to buy local fruits and vegetables
- How to take control of your health
- How to subscribe to vegetable baskets near me
- Finance a local producer
- Know what you're eating

### Facebook  
Facebook would serve both as a business card that users can share with friends, a means of informing about new products on sale or events organized at the farm. Customers can also leave reviews to judge their shopping experience.

## Development  

I use the Boutique Ado project from Code Institute like a boilerplate.  

The organization of the website is very simple. It is composed of several content pages, accessible to all:  
- Home page  
- Products  
- Contact  
- Shopping Bag  
- Checkout  

Login pages for: 
- register  
- log in  
- log out  
- edit the profile  

Admins have access to a dedicated area where they can consult lists of users and orders, as well as lists of products and their categories. Like users, they can also manage the catalog by logging on to the website. They can add, edit or delete products.   
 
Pages 404 and 500 are also available. 

### Database  
-__Json Files__  
I decide to create json files for adding my categories and products to the database. This allows me to keep a backup of the database in case I need to reinitialize it. If I upload products and categories directly via the admin panel, I could lose everything. So I prefer to use json files.  
I then copied the "categories" file from the boutique Ado project. And replace the categories with my own. I then uploaded the categories.json file to the IDE with the **python3 manage.py loaddata categories** command, which retrieves the data stored in this file.  
To create the JSON file for my products, I first gathered all my information (name, price, image name, image url, category, sku, descriptions, etc.) in an excel document.  

![EXCEL DOCUMENT WITH PRODUCTS](/media/screenshots/excel-file-products.png)  

Then, I converted this excel document into JSON format with [this convertor](https://codebeautify.org/excel-to-json).  
I then formatted this file with (Json Formatter)[https://jsonformatter.org] to make it more compact. I then pasted the data into a "products.json" document and typed the **python3 manage.py loaddata products** command to retrieve the data stored in this file.

### Page Construction  
I used **Django templates** to build my pages.  
The source file for html pages is **base.html**. The different content pages use this document to load common elements such as the footer or the navigation, among others. The content pages only contain their own content. The latter calls the header and footer, which are two different files stored in the **"includes" folder**. I made this choice because I want my base.html file to be as clear as possible. There's a lot of information in the footer and header, plus two menus, one for large screens and the collapse menu.  
The stylesheet is called by the link **{% static 'css/style.css' %}** so that all pages regardless of their location.  

### Menu
The menu presents the different product categories (vegetables, fruit, other products), as well as access to registration and login to the customer account. There is also access to the profile if the user is logged in. The user also has access to the shopping bag.  
The menu is condensed when the site is used on a small screen. Products, login information and the shopping bag are then accessed via the hamburger icon. I didn't want to have a dropdown menu to facilitate user experience and reading. I therefore decided to group certain categories under the "other products" link. "Other products" includes dry vegetabes, groceries, plants and seeds.  

### Online Paiement  
Online payment is handled by the **Stripe service**. There are a number of steps involved in getting the service up and running. You can help yourself with the Stripe documentation for installation.  

To use Stripe's services, you need to set up an account and confirm your e-mail address. The latter gives access to the developer mode, which enables you to test whether online payment works correctly on your site. All you need to do is enter a fictitious card (made up of a series of numbers 42) to run the tests.  

![STRIPE DEVELOPER VIEW](/media/screenshots/stripe-developers-view.png) 

In addition to the various information to be included in the settings.py document, the public and secret keys to be entered in the env.py document (so that they remain hidden when the site goes online) and in the Config Vars in the Heroku settings, you need to add the Javascript line **<script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>** in the **{% corejs %}** block of the base.html page. Stripe recommends adding this line in this document so that the service is accessible on all pages of the site, which allows some of their more advanced fraud detection features to work.  

### Email Management  
To send emails to the users, to confirm them their account or their order, you can use Gmail. You need to connect to a Gmail account, or create one. Then go to :  
- Settings > Accounts and import > Other Google Account Settings > Security  
- Click on "Signing in to Google"  
- 2-Step Verification is used to create an app password to allow Django to use the Gmail account to send emails  
- Enter password and telephone number to verify the account  
- Go to App password and create one  
- Select “Mail” and call it “Django Send Email”  
- Copy the password  
- Go on Heroku and add a new variable called EMAIL_HOST_PASS and paste the password as value  
- Add also a new variable called EMAIL_HOST_USER and paste the email address as value  

Then go to the settings.py file and add a few new settings at the end of the file:  

![EMAIL SENDING SETTINGS](/media/screenshots/email-sending-settings.png) 

### Newsletter  
To send newsletters via the Mailchimp service, follow these steps:  
1. Install mailchimp with the command:  
>pip3 install mailchimp-marketing  
2. Create a mailchimp account  
3. go to Account, Extra and create an API key  
4. Copy this API key and paste it into the env.py file  
5. Then go to the Audience tab and select Settings and Audience name and detaults  
Copy the Audience ID and paste it into settings.py  

![MAILCHIMP SETTINGS](/media/screenshots/mailchimp-settings.png) 

### Features  
-__Home Page__  
The Home Page welcomes the user with a photo of vegetables, so that at a glance the user has an idea of the products sold on the site. A button gives access to all the products. Text informs the user of the company's activities and values, and provides SEO information. Important words are then placed either in headlines or in bold.  

-__Products__  
The page presents all the products on sale on the website. Items are presented with product name, photo, selling price, selling weight and weight per kilo.  

-__Product Details__  
Each product has its own dedicated page. On it, the user can find the product image, the artist's name, the weight per kilo, the sales weight (i.e. how much is sold for one unit of the product) and the sales price.
A brief description presents the product, with cooking instructions or tasting suggestions. It is possible to choose a quantity and add this selection to the basket.  

-__Shopping Bag__  
The shopping basket enables users to identify at a glance the items they have selected and wish to purchase. The photo and name of the product are of course shown, along with the weight, quantity and selling price. The latter is multiplied by the quantity if several units have been selected.  

The user can view the amount of the products, the shipping costs and the total amount to be paid. Shipping costs are 10% of the total amount. The user can decide to modify products, add or subtract quantities, or remove the product from the basket. The amounts to be paid and shipping costs are then automatically updated. Finally, the user can decide whether to continue shopping or proceed to payment by clicking on "Secure checkout".  

![SHOPPING BAG](/media/screenshots/shopping-bag.png)  

-__Checkout__  
This page allows the user to enter personal information. These are automatically filled in if the user has a customer account. 
Bank details are entered here. Online payment is handled by Stripe.  

![CHECKOUT](/media/screenshots/checkout.png)  

-__Order Confirmation__  
The order confirmation allows the user to view his order summary. This shows them what they have ordered, their personal details and the total to be paid.  

![ORDER CONFIRMATION](/media/screenshots/order-confirmation.png)  

-__Newsletter__  
The user can choose to subscribe to the newsletter in order to receive the latest news from the farm. Only email and name are required. The name allows us to send more personalized emails by displaying the customer's name. The newsletter is sent via the Mailchimp service.   

![NEWSLETTER](/media/screenshots/newsletter.png)  

-__Profile__  
Users can register with their e-mail address, a username and a password to create a personal account on the website. As with any other e-commerce site, this account enables the user to save personal information such as their postal address, so that they don't have to enter it again if they order from the site. This page also provides an order history.  

-__Confirmation Emails__  
The user receives emails to validate his account, if he forgets his password, and so on.
It is possible to personalize these emails, making them dynamic by displaying the information entered by the user.  

![CONFIRMATION EMAILS](/media/screenshots/confirmation-email.png)  

-__Contact__
The user can send a message to the site administrators to request more information, for example. The user must enter his or her name, e-mail address, telephone number (optional) and message.  

-__Admin Panel__  
The admin panel gives the administrator access to information concerning his activity:   
- users, where it is possible to view personal information concerning users registered on the site  
- orders, the administrator can view all orders placed on his website, with date, amount, customer information and, of course, order details 
- categories  
- products  

-__Add Product__  
The administrator doesn't need to go to the Admin panel to add products to his online catalog. To do so, it is possible to add an item directly, along with its information and photo, by clicking on the little man in the superuser account and selecting "Product Management".  

-__Edit Product__  
Like adding a product, the administrator can edit an item without going to the Admin panel. It is possible to modify all the information attached to a product.  

-__Delete Product__  
The administrator can also delete a product from his online catalog directly from the website, without being connected to the admin panel.  

### Features Left to Implement  
-__Instagram Account__  
An Instagram account is especially useful when it's possible to take new photos and tell a story to involve web users in your business. What's more, users are looking for the human and the local on platforms like Instagram.  

-__Stock management__  
It would be useful to be able to add stock information so that administrators could keep track of their sales. It would be a real shame if there were sales on a product that was no longer available.  

-__Recipe blog__  
A blog allows you to add new content to your website on a regular basis. Sharing cooking recipes featuring the products sold on the site would offer ideas to Internet users, who might then take the plunge and buy certain vegetables with which they are not familiar.  

-__Basket subscription__  
Les Jardins could offer users the chance to subscribe to weekly or monthly baskets. This provides a fixed income stream and builds customer loyalty. Customers can then have a basket of fruit and/or vegetables delivered to their home on a regular basis, at their own pace.

## Testing  
The content about testing is stocked in this document [testing.md](/TESTING.md)  

## Deployment  
The website has been deployed via Heroku.  The project is created on GitHub with the 'gitpod full template' provided by [Code Institute](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).

The project name is lesjardins.  

-__Install Django and supporting libraries__  
On Gitpod, it is necessary to install Django and supporting libraries. I decide to follow the deployment steps proposed by Code Institute.

1. Install Django4, psycopg2 and Cloudinary  
>pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn  
>pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2  
>pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage  

2. Then create the requirements file with the command :  
>pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt  

-__Create an external database__  
ElephantSQL is the service of choice for creating an external database.

1. Create a free account  
2. Create new instance  
3. Name the database with the project name  
4. Choose a geographical region  
5. Copy the URL of the database  

-__Create an app in Heroku__  
1. Create a new app  
2. Open the Settings tab  
3. Reveal Config Vars  
4. Add a new Config Var called DATABASE_URL and paste the external database URL as the value  
5. Add a new Config Var called SECRET_KEY and paste my Secret Key  

-__Create the env.py file__  
This file contains the secret datas about the project.  

>import os os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "Paste the database URL" os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "My Secret Key"  

-__Prepare the environment__  
1. Do a reference to the env.py on the settings file.  
>import os import dj_database_url  
>  
>if os.path.isfile("env.py"): import env  

2. Remove the secret key and link it to the SECRET_KEY variable on Heroku.  
>SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')  

3. Comment out the old database section. And paste a new database paragraph and link to the DATABASE_URL variable on Heroku.  
>DATABASES = { 'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL")) }  

4. Make the migrations.  

-__Create the media files stored__  
1. Cloudinary is the service used to stored the media.  

2. Need to create an account  
3. Copy the API Environment Variable available in the dashboard  
4. In the env.py file, paste the API previously copied  
>os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "cloudinary://************************"  

5. Create a Config Vars in Heroku and to paste the API previously copied as a value  
6. Create a new Config Vars with DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC as key and 1 as value. I will remove this new entry at the end of the project.  
7. Add Cloudinary libraries to the installed apps in settings.py :  
>'cloudinary_storage', 'cloudinary',  

8. Specify to Django to use Cloudinary to store media and static files  
>STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage' STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')] STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')  
>  
>MEDIA_URL = '/media/' DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'  

9. Link with the templates directory :  
>TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')  

10. Change the templates directory :  
>'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR],  

11. Add Heroku Hostname to ALLOWED_HOSTS  
12. Create three new folders : media, static and templates  
13. Create a new file with the name Procfile  
14. In the Procfile file, add the code :  
>web: gunicorn outscape.wsgi

- InDesign  
The wireframes were made with InDesign software. This is not the software commonly used on this kind of file, but I know this software well because I've been using it for years, I feel at ease on it and I spend less time making the wireframes with this software than with a more common online solution.
